# Contributing to Open Deep Search APIs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **open-deep-search-api**, an open-source Software as a Service (SaaS) project for deep search capabilities powered by Firebase and large language models (LLMs). Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your contributions are welcome!

This project uses Firebase (Firestore and Cloud Functions) with JavaScript, integrating LLMs like OpenAI, DeepSeek R1, and Gemini. Contributors can either run the project locally (bringing their own environment) or interact with our hosted API endpoints.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Getting Started

Before contributing, ensure you understand the project:

- **Purpose**: Provides deep search functionality via API endpoints, leveraging LLMs for deep semantic understanding.
- **Tech Stack**: Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions), JavaScript (Node.js), and LLM APIs (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini).
- **License**: MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)).

You can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs or suggesting features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[your-username]/deep-search-saas/issues).
- Submitting pull requests (PRs) with code, docs, or tests.

### 2. Setting Up Your Environment

To run this project locally, youâ€™ll need to bring your own environment (Firebase project, API keys, etc.). Alternatively, you can use our hosted API endpoints for testing.
